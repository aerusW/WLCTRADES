# WLCTRADES
WLCTRADES is a tool debeloped specifically to interact with the wlc minecraft plugin used in the [topaz earth minecraft server](https://topazearth.org/). 

It fetches all trades from the server’s public API, saves them into a JSON file, and then decodes the Base64-encoded item data so it’s easy to read and use.

The tool also parses each item stack, letting you see what items are involved in a trade (for example, the item type and the amount).

WLCTRADES is mainly meant for automations, scripts, or anything that needs clean and readable trade data from the server.
